# AdventurersLife
A little game I'm writing in SFML and C++


Build it yourself!
Dependencies:
 - SFML [Download here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)
 - nlohmann json parser [Download here](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
 - Visual Studio Code, because I'm lazy and I won't provide other build scripts, they are already set up for this editor :PP [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

Game features almost complete implementation of [Tiled editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) exported maps.
